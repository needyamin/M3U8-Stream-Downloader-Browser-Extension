REQUIRED ICON FILES FOR THE EXTENSION
====================================

To complete the M3U8 Stream Downloader extension, you need to add the following PNG icon files to this directory:

1. icon16.png  (16x16 pixels)
2. icon32.png  (32x32 pixels)
3. icon48.png  (48x48 pixels)
4. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

ICON DESIGN SUGGESTIONS:
- Use a video/media-related icon (play button, download arrow, streaming symbol)
- Colors: Blue/purple gradient to match the extension theme (#667eea, #764ba2)
- Make sure the icon is recognizable at small sizes (16x16)
- Use a transparent background
- Keep the design simple and modern

WHERE TO GET ICONS:
- Create your own using image editing software
- Download from icon libraries (Flaticon, Icons8, etc.)
- Use online icon generators
- Convert SVG icons to PNG

EXAMPLE SEARCH TERMS:
- "download video icon"
- "streaming icon"
- "HLS icon"
- "video download arrow"
- "media player icon"

Once you add these files, the extension will be ready to install in Chrome!

Note: The extension will not load properly without these icon files, as they are referenced in the manifest.json file.
