- ‚úÖ Check that `manifest.json` exists in the root folder
- ‚úÖ Verify Developer mode is enabled
- ‚úÖ Try refreshing the extensions page and reloading

### **Extension Icon Missing**

- Make sure filenames are exactly: `icon16.png`, `icon32.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`

### **Popup Won't Open**
- Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
- Verify `popup.html`, `popup.js`, and `popup.css` files exist
- Try reloading the extension

### **No Streams Detected**

- Check the browser's Network tab to see if .m3u8 files are being loaded
